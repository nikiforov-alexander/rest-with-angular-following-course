    <h1>My Tasks</h1>

    <!-- By setting this div.ng-controller to mainCtrl
         We define mainCtrl scope to be inside this div
     -->
    <div ng-controller="MainController" class="list">

        <!--
            Show flash message if it is not null
        -->
        <div ng-show="flash != null"
             ng-class="{
             'error': flash.status == 'ERROR',
             'success': flash.status == 'SUCCESS'
             }"
             class="item flash">
            {{flash.message}}
        </div>

        <!--
        This div simply shows a button to add new task
        -->
        <div class="add">
            <a href="#" ng-click="addNewTask()">
                + Add a New Task</a>
        </div>

        <!--
        This div is shown only when no Tasks left
        -->
        <div ng-show="tasks.length == 0" class="item">
            <span>No Tasks</span>
        </div>

        <!--
        1. The ng-class directive applied 'editing-item' class
          to our "div" if, condition is true, i.e. when
          editing == true.
          This div class will be set to "edited", when
          "task.edited" is true, i.e. when we edited any of our
          tasks
        -->
        <div ng-repeat="task in tasks"
             ng-class="{
             'editing-item': editing == true,
             'edited': task.edited == true
             }"
             class="item">
             <!--
             By adding ng-model here, we can save in $scope
             variable "task", and use it later on.
             If we use "task.name", then we'll have "task"
             object with property "name".
             For now it seems that $scope.task.name is seen
             whereas not resolved by IDE
             2. Now when user clicks on checkbox, i.e. makes
             Task completed, he also makes task.edited = true,
             i.e. 'Save' button appears
             -->
            <input ng-model="task.completed"
                   type="checkbox"
                   ng-click="task.edited = true">

            <!--
            ng-show directive with "editing" shows the
            label when "editing = false".
            When user clicks on label, Task goes into
            editing mode automatically. In order to get back
            one has to click elsewhere
            2. Important thing here for ng-blur to work:
            We have to keep in mind that "for" attribute
            is bound to "id" attribute, and we have to keep
            then UNIQUE and same for both label and input
            otherwise, ng-blur will not work
            -->
            <label ng-show="editing == false"
                   ng-click="editing = true"
                   class="editing-label"
                   for="{{'task-input-' + $index}}">
                {{task.name}}
            </label>

            <!--
            1. input is shown when "editing = true"
            2. ng-blur sets editing to false, when
              we click somewhere outside input, and
              after that input becomes inactive, while
              label with ng-show becomes active
            3. "ng-change" will fire when input changes,
              setting "task.edited" to "true", so that
              we change our CSS class in "div" above
              and show "edited" near our Task.
            -->
            <input ng-model="task.name"
                   ng-change="task.edited = true"
                   ng-show="editing == true"
                   ng-blur="editing = false"
                   id="{{'task-input-' + $index}}"
                   type="text"
                   class="editing-label">

            <div class="actions">
                <a ng-click="editing = !editing"
                   href=""
                   class="edit">
                    Edit
                </a>
                <!-- by using ng-click we look in controller for
                     function, that will be called upon click on this
                     anchor element. Another fun thing is that
                     you can probably put ng-click on any element, like
                     header for example ! and it will work.
                     Note 2. This 'Save' button will show up only
                     if Task is edited.
                -->
                <a href=""
                   ng-click="saveTask(task)"
                   ng-show="task.edited == true"

                    Save

                available inside ng-repeat, to facilitate
